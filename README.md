# Interesting Read about the Limitations of LLM

[All You Need to Know About the Limitations of Large Language Models](https://medium.com/@marketing_novita.ai/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-limitations-of-large-language-models-568e15f66809)

I found this article interesting as a student who regularly uses large language models because it clearly explained limitations that I’ve often experienced firsthand while also offering solutions. Whether in my personal life, in tech projects, or through an API integration in an internship, I frequently use LLMs. What I found most useful were the explanations of why these limitations happen and the strategies to address them.

Most notably, **Limitation 3: LLMs Can’t Update Their Knowledgebase in Real-Time** outlined how LLMs are built on static data and why new data can’t be made available instantaneously due to resource inefficiency. I liked the idea of combining APIs that fetch the latest information—something I may even use in the future.

I also appreciated the writing approach of this article. I typically enjoy Medium articles because they tend to be less technical and explain complex concepts in a friendly way. This article supplemented my understanding of the limitations LLMs face and provided practical solutions to these issues.

**Comment by Carine Ilie:**

I agree with your take on how clearly the article broke down the limitations of LLMs. I also found Limitation 3 really interesting, especially because it highlights how much we take real-time information for granted when using these tools. I think the suggestion of combining APIs with LLMs is super practical—it feels like the next step in making them more useful for everyday work.
